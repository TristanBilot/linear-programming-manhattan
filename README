# Optimization of the placement of relay points on Manhattan using a linear program
This program is an algorithm using linear programming to solve an optimization problem which is to minimize the Manhattan distance of given points.
A clustering method is used to divide the population in several sub-groups on which apply the Simplex algorithm.
